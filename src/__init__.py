# src/__init__.py

# This file serves to mark the 'src' directory as a Python package.
# This allows for relative imports between modules within the 'src' directory,
# for example: from . import newsapi

# It is often left empty, but can also be used for package-level initialization
# or defining package-wide variables/functions if needed.

# For this project, it can remain empty.
